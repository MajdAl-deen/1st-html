                    What is coding?

                    
                    Coding is a skill where you take instructions (the steps in a task) and translate it into a language
                    the computer understands since computers do not communicate like humans. They communicate in a
                    language called BINARY and it is uses 0’s and 1’s.

                    Coders write the instructions using a programming language.

                    This programming language translates human code into computer code known as software.

                    What does a "coder" do?
                    Coders are problem solvers.

                    They look at a problem, break it down into bite size steps and create solutions that solve the
                    problem. For me, I have always enjoyed this!

                    Those who possess coding skills will find that there are many jobs in many locations, salaries are
                    very good, the ability to work away from the office space, and the field is growing.

                    Even if you do not want to be a coder, knowing the basics of software programming will help you use
                    computers more productively and since computing devices are appearing in so many careers, this will
                    be very helpful to you.

                    What is a programming language?
                    When you write programming code, you use KEYWORDS, SYNTAX and OPERATORS. These are common in all
                    programming languages.

                    What programming languages exist?
                    There is a long list of programming languages with new ones appearing every few years. Here are some
                    that have been around a while.

                    Examples of programming languages:

                    * Java
                    * C, C++, C#
                    * COBOL (yes….it is still an active language)
                    * Objective C
                    * Swift
